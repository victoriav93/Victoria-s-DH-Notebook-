## Text Analysis

****What is text? 
Formulating a working defintion:
- a process rather than a tool.
- within a data set.
- Ultimately more than technology. 
- nature of the data set.
- indentify rather than track.

Text analysis is a process that allows for information (signficance & meaning) to be apprehended from data as a means to track,identify, and compare patterns and trends to work towards a conclusion.
- Fear of falling behind.
