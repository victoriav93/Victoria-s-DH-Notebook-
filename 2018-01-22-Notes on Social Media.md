Social media

-While it can be argued that propaganda stands apart from scholarly work I think it can be argued that in our day and age
that the lines between academia and propaganda are becoming more unclear.
- I think it is really interesting that propogranda is defined by intent because often times people spred (particularly through facebook) false infromation not knowing the difference from fake news and fact.
-While Shaffer does acknowledge the complexity of Propaganda in the world of social media, his conclusion is a tad too optimistic for my tendencies....
- I find it really interesting, the idea of needing to have a public image now in Academia because it highlights that
as the the BA is far less significant as it may have been even a few decades ago, and thus the question becomes how do I make my research known/ how do I make people care about my research? And i think, in the digital age self-marketing and perhaps becoming an academic microcelebrity is necessary.
-Despite the many worrying things about social media that we have encountered in some of the other readings, I like this notion of Academic microcelebrity, which enables the academic voice and the marginalized voice to expand and disseminate outside of the constraints of academia.

“Microcelebrity is the economics of attention in which academics are being encouraged, mostly through normative pressure, to brand their academic knowledge for mass consumption.”
