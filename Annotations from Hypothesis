I find this extremely relevant. During the talk on Digital Humanities lead by Professor Greenspan, it became clear this is a hot topic in Digital Humanities right now.In essence, we discussed the pushback from scholars in accepting these forms of 'sound writing' as someone's thesis, instead of the standard paper.

By watching video tutorials or simply tinkering with software, scores of people have taught themselves to independently produce high quality podcasts, songs, soundscapes, and other projects
The notion of these softwares also bring into the question of accessibility again. On the one hand, it is great to open up these resources to those outside of the professional domain, it does also bring up the idea of who can afford these softwares--for instance, Reaper is only free for 60 days and Garage band has 5$ in-app purchases.

CGirard 2018-03-05 11:45 AM in group 9ZoPkNzN
I agree with your statement and want to add that while these resources are available to a wider public, I would assume it is mostly people using these tools for professional purposes who are purchasing them. That way, their work pays for the program, which is counter-intuitive to making the programs accessible.

Ryan.Bathurst 2018-02-22 5:11 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
I think it's great that a fair amount of these video tutorials and tools are available online but I also agree with what you are saying. The paywalls that people come across are always problematic and obviously limiting.

Beginning this discussion on sound and having attended the OttawaU event on music, I think this unit is extremely important in moving away (to some degree) from DH being rooted solely in the written word; as this may be hard for some of us, especially the English majors, it will be interesting to explore further the important of DH in music as well.

roostersmiles 2018-03-11 12:17 AM in group 9ZoPkNzN
I think I'm on the fence about this. DH seems to be rooted to me in the digital space, in visualization and mapping, as with other discussions, we saw the focus put on using the digital space in different ways.

Text mining does seem more accessible, especially for English and Linguistics disciplines, where a quantified, linked and clustered model of the smallest unit of meaning (the word or more accurately a morpheme) is relevant.

However, syntax, prosody and cadence are also significant in analyzing written and oral text, and perhaps needs more focus in this domain of DH.

ayana.morgenstern 2018-03-10 12:32 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
I agree that primacy seems to be placed on the written word, and it is these non-traditional ways of analysis that I am intrigued by.

victoriav93 2018-01-17 10:53 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
Institutions, publics, and some media elites are encouraging academics to be more visible in the public sphere
While this is definitely intwined with the notion of the university as 'corporate' but given the increased accessibility to post-secondary education, I cannot help if the masses create this necessity to brand research. As we all have heard, the BA is far less significant as it may have been even a few decades ago, and thus the question becomes how do I make my research known/ how do I make people care about my research? And i think, in the digital age self-marketing and perhaps becoming an academic microcelebrity is necessary.

CGirard 2018-01-19 4:55 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
While I agree that self-marketing is important in this day and age, the information that is being shared is probably tailored or monitored to ensure it remains PC and in line with the academic institutions values, which can be limiting to an academic. What I mean is scholars are probably not all posting what their true beliefs or fact-based opinions are because they don't want to get in trouble with their institution should it go against the grain. We then into issues of author reliability.

victoriav93 2018-01-17 10:48 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
Microcelebrity is the economics of attention in which academics are being encouraged, mostly through normative pressure, to brand their academic knowledge for mass consumption.
While it appears so far that Cottom is seeing the branding of Academics as negative ( which is understandable in terms of the trolls) but I still do understand how this may be necessary in the digital age.

As an English major, this is one of the things that intrigued me about the Digital Humanities; the vast amount of literature available now, across disciplines, due to digitalizing books and texts has drastically changed the way we research.

CGirard 2017-10-25 7:27 PM in group 9ZoPkNzN
I agree with you and must add that it has also helped that contemporary novels are almost always printed and digitized simultaneously, which means there is no need to go back and digitize them later.

The reason I bring up this point is because while many older texts are now digitized there is still those that haven't made the transition yet. At some point someone has to make a decision on what is worth digitizing and what isn't, which brings up many more problems in turn. If only the "best of the best" can be digitized (speaking to much older texts) then our data set isn't representative of the whole, only the part. Therefore, can our research really be sound?
