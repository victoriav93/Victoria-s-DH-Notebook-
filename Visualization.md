**Speak to the Eyes: The History and Practice of Information Visualization**

-Visual representation to revel patterns, to communicate complex ideas, and to tell stories. Now it is HOW we do rather than WHAT that has changed.

- Need to understand the history— in order to fully grasp and make advancements. 

- Begs the question, can we advance without full knowledge of the past?

- Things are constantly changing, that is true, but the question is are we not just resurfacing most of the time? For instance, 
Playfairs line graphs, bar charts, and pie graphs.

-This used to be on paper, but now we have a more advanced means of explaining and generating these.

- Idea of a universal language in terms of a visualization; draws on the idea of “ a picture says 1000 words.”

- Notion that embellishment of information detracts from the data, such as with Chartjunk. I have to say I disagree with this as  often time plain charts and graphs can be dull and unmemorable, but in the example provided in the article it draws your attention ( or at least in my case) to how the data and comic work together, which as a result enforces your attention.
“new methods of visualization will emerge as new technologies themselves emerge” This quote relates back to my earlier observations, the how of what are we are doing are constantly evolving, but our aim is generally the same.

**‘Digital Surrealism: Visualizing Walt Disney Animation Studios’ DHQ 11.1**

- At first fairly confusing as to how multiple frames merged together could reveal something.

- As the article continues, it becomes clear that visualization is a lot like text analysis, but with images.

- This method also becomes even more familiar as an English major, as you are interpreting a text, or in this case an image, and coming to possible conclusions; in other words, there is not always a right or wrong answer.

- Some of the conclusion that the author of the project draws are extremely fascinating as it is able to expose hidden meaning that could not be caught by the human eye.
    - Similar to the Big Book project, once again, Digital humanities enables us to utilize these tools that change not what we are doing, but how we are doing it. This project allowed the author to come to conclusions that would not have been visible without technology.

-While I can understand the skepticism, as many people tend to be with Literary Studies, which questions if these conclusions go beyond mere speculation.
   - However, I would have to argue, while these conclusions can be challenged and researched further to solidify the author's conclusions, I think what is important here is that it opens the door for conversation.

- The digital tool enabled the author to bring these issues to the surface, in which the 'human' aspect of Digital Humanities comes into play; the researcher may now begin to ask further questions and opens the door for scholarly discussion.

**Seminar on Visualization **

 
**Defintion of Visualization:**

 - OED: The action or fact of visualization; the power or process of forming a menatal picture or vision of something not actually present to the sight; a picutre thus formed(1883-94)
 - OED: The action or process of rendering visible (1926-82).
 - Lev Manovich: " A mapping between discrete data and visual representation."
         -- Bridging rather than mapping? Purpose:  to tell a story or exploratory  nature.
- How does digital impact/complicate?

**Types:**

Information visualization:
 - Graphs, piechats, and linegraphed. 
 - What the graph does not tell you -- example: midterm week (papers due).

Scientific visualization:

- Scans. 
- Ex: MRI, CTSCAN.


Geovisualization:

-Mapping and urban geolocating. 
-Example: elections and the results.


**Data:**

- Spatial, Non-Spatial, Numeric, and Non-Numeric.
