Class notes:
- How the community is used to produce and maintain websites.
- A good example can be seen with the idea of Google Maps-- you can see the names of streets, the most recent image of the
location. and how to access or walk to the location.
- The example of Kibera map which helped provide safe ways to go to reduce sexual assault.
- How can what be incorporated into the map change our perspective?
- For exmaple Waze-- the map allows drivers to be aware of accidents, to actively participate in the narrative, and warn
them of cops. 
- capta is active, data is given - recorde dobserved
- the example of the broken tree-- does that provide us with any crucial information? Is it something that we should want to know?

## Community in Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities
Concepts, Models, and Experiment

- Examples of 18th connect which provides a new way to crowd source and provides useful infromation for scholars:
- "The collaboratively annotated text is accessible for undergraduate students to read, or could provide a model
for students to create their own digital scholarly editions of texts".

## Crowdmilking

- The idea of playbour and how crowdsourcing can also be problematic.
- By having the world at your fingertips and being able to reach out to the general public, 
Employers are able to get free labour from others.
- For instance the striking example in which o, for example if you are a client who is looking for a logo you might spend the very reasonable sum of $300. And for that you receive 116 completely executed designs. But of these 116 designers only one will receive the payment of $180, and 
Iâ€™m not sure if I have to spell this out but that means that 115 designers worked for free, for no pay at all. (Schmidt)"
- This is quite worrying as it means that especially those in the Arts may be taken advantage of.
