Class notes:
- How the community is used to produce and maintain websites.
- A good example can be seen with the idea of Google Maps-- you can see the names of streets, the most recent image of the
location. and how to access or walk to the location.
- The example of Kibera map which helped provide safe ways to go to reduce sexual assault.
- How can what be incorporated into the map change our perspective?
- For exmaple Waze-- the map allows drivers to be aware of accidents, to actively participate in the narrative, and warn
them of cops. 
- capta is active, data is given - recorde dobserved
- the example of the broken tree-- does that provide us with any crucial information? Is it something that we should want to know?
