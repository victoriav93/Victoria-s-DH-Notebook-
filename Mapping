Class notes:
- How the community is used to produce and maintain websites.
- A good example can be seen with the idea of Google Maps-- you can see the names of streets, the most recent image of the
location. and how to access or walk to the location.
- The example of Kibera map which helped provide safe ways to go to reduce sexual assault.
- How can what be incorporated into the map change our perspective?
- For exmaple Waze-- the map allows drivers to be aware of accidents, to actively participate in the narrative, and warn
them of cops. 
- capta is active, data is given - recorde dobserved
- the example of the broken tree-- does that provide us with any crucial information? Is it something that we should want to know?

Mapping
Diana S. Sinton

- Like our understanding of Google Maps, or waze, the "all at once, a map can be compelling, informative, and revealing,
and usually non-threatening,save for those who experience anxiety when forced to navigate with one.
- Highlights how humanities scholars who have ventured into this realm of digital mapping have produced a
rich variety of projects-- an interesting example of this can be seen with a Holocaust mapping project that was conducted by
Uottawa students that showed a map and created visualizations highlighting the amounts of deaths per year of the War.
