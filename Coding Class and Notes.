* Languages
* Instructions
Act of Coding:

Idea of Building Blocks.
The Barriers of Gatekeeping:
===============================
* Harold Innis:  hierarchy --comes down to power and money.
* Toxicity of asking who is a coder? 


What is Code? Paul Ford

* Alongside the readings for this text, is a helpful (and often times annoying) 
bot that provides information on the code at work in the text.
* Brings attention to the work that is being done out of sight--realization of how little we know about the tools we use
everyday.
* Idea that "Coding is a broad human activity, like sport, or writing."
* Highlights the complexity of code in order to make something functional, even a minor error can prevent it from working.
* One idea that really stood out to me is how "Itâ€™s a good and healthy exercise to ponder what your computer is doing right now".
  We often do not think of how something works, but it is interesting how DH forces you to think about it.
