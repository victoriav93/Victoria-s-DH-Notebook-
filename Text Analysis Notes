- Topic modelling --texts on one side and topics come out of the other side.
- Encounter patterns that you have to explain.
- Falling out of fashion -- require a tool that move your works.
- Analysis needs to drive the tool.

- Achille's heel: need to know how many buckets you are looking for.
      -This is only a problem if you think the computer should tell you.
- Not about finding an answer, but vision of your work.
