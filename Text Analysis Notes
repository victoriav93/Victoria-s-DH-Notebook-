## Text Analysis

****What is text? 
Formulating a working defintion:
- a process rather than a tool.
- within a data set.
- Ultimately more than technology. 
- nature of the data set.
- indentify rather than track.

Text analysis is a process that allows for information (signficance & meaning) to be apprehended from data as a means to track,identify, and compare patterns and trends to work towards a conclusion.
- Fear of falling behind.

-Counting and counting things in scale.
**Mining the dispatch:**
- Topic modelling --texts on one side and topics come out of the other side.
- Encounter patterns that you have to explain.
- Falling out of fashion -- require a tool that move your works.
- Analysis needs to drive the tool.
- Distribution over distribution--machine is looking at each word in relationship to every other word, the text as a whole, and the corpus.
- Achille's heel: need to know how many buckets you are looking for.
      -This is only a problem if you think the computer should tell you.
- Not about finding an answer, but vision of your work.

- Underline words that are about health and society -- percentage of the words in the text-- stimulates the process completed by a Voyant Tools.

Text Analysis, Data Mining, and Visualizations in Literary Scholarship:

-Dehumanization of the digital humanities.

-Van Dyke and Gass—using different methods to look at smaller pieces of the puzzle and work towards the whole.

-Surprised to see the DH in English starting as early as 1987—on a topic that is interested to me.

-Tools lacking self-conscious element. These tools act more as a first step of research to point out anomalies, but right now it is up to the researcher to discover the root cause of the findings.

-Allows for a comparison method to establish patterns…interesting as literature and comparison methods have often been favoured and now it is emerging through another methodology.

-Ability to achieve things that would not be possible with close readings due to shorter repetitions.

-collaboration in the DH- something I am beginning to adjust with myself, as literary studies has often been conducted in isolation.

CLIR:“the need to ‘bridge’ a gap between automated computational analysis and interpretive reasoning that must make allowances for doubt, uncertainty, and/or multiple possibilities” is a need that “is characteristic of the Challenge projects.”

-But Literary inquiry prepares us to read these complexities as an approach of alternatives and as plausible interpretations instead of truth.

—constant inconsistency within literature; thee is never truth.

—literature undervalued, many that have not been explored, allows for quicker exploration.

Healy, Kieran. ‘Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere’

-Idea of narrowing suspects with different tools with limited amount of information.

Utilizing social networks and digital tools.
Michel, Jean-Baptiste, et al. 2011 “Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books,” Science Vol. 331, 176 (14 January 2011).

-It is interesting the amount of work we have been able to do, on a macrolevel, that would not be possible without the tools we have now.

-Even though it feels as if all of literature is a click away, we have hardly digitalized the majority of literature.

While doing a close reading is necessary, at times, a distant reading is not something we could do on our own--we would tend to gloss over some of the comparisons.
